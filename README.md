# Array Statistics Calculator

This Java program is designed to perform various statistical calculations on an input array. It provides functions to analyze the elements of the array, such as counting different elements, counting even and odd numbers, calculating the frequency of elements, finding the maximum occurrence, finding the largest and smallest numbers, calculating the average, standard deviation, and median, summing all the numbers, counting palindromic numbers, and finding the second largest palindromic number.

## Features

- Count the number of elements in the array.
- Count the number of different elements in the array.
- Count the number of even and odd numbers in the array.
- Calculate the frequency of each element in the array.
- Find the element with the maximum occurrence in the array.
- Find the largest and smallest numbers in the array.
- Find the second smallest number in the array.
- Calculate the average of all numbers in the array.
- Calculate the standard deviation of the numbers in the array.
- Calculate the median of the numbers in the array.
- Sum all the numbers in the array.
- Count the number of palindromic numbers in the array.
- Find the largest palindromic number that is smaller than the greatest number in the array.
- Reverse and print the palindromic elements in the array and the inserted elements in reverse order.
